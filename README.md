<h3>System monitor extension for Argos</h3>

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/HcIqehd.png">

This is extension I created specially for [Argos](https://github.com/p-e-w/argos) and linux-powered computers.
It is based on *free*, *top* and *vmstat* output.

Do before you going to use this:

```sudo apt install top sysstat```
